# Form Validation Test (for Springload)

I have made a simple form based on the criteria set out on [this link](https://github.com/springload/form-validation-problem/). I have done this site based on a Mobile-First Approach as that will allow me to use that screen size as a baseline for design. I have tested this website on Chrome,  Safari, and Safari for iOS( on an iPhone SE 1st Generation)as those are the browser I have access to.

The bootstrap Framework(version 5.1.1) is heavily utilised here as it is the framework I am most familiar with and it reduces the time required to build the basic structure of the site.

If I have more time, I would do more testing to check for different scenarios. I would also add more helpful prompts for the user. While I was able to put the character condition on the password validation, I was unable to set up a prompt to inform the user if they have less than 8 characters. For now, I have just added a line in the input area stating "more than 8 characters" as a temporary fix. I was also unable to set up a prompt to inform users when the form is successfully validated and submitted. I was also unable to get the validation to run on click. However, The basic required functionality should have been all addressed.
